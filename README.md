🚀 TBO TripGuard
AI-Powered Travel Disruption Prediction & Management Platform
📌 Project Overview

TBO TripGuard is an AI-based travel intelligence platform designed to predict, prevent, and manage travel disruptions such as flight delays, cancellations, and weather-related risks.

The system analyzes multiple risk factors including weather conditions, travel schedules, and historical disruption patterns to generate risk scores and provide smart alternative suggestions.

This project was developed as part of a hackathon initiative to demonstrate how Artificial Intelligence can enhance reliability and decision-making in the travel industry.

🎯 Objective

The goal of TripGuard is to move from reactive problem handling to proactive risk prediction, helping:

Travelers avoid unexpected disruptions

Travel agencies provide better service

Businesses reduce operational uncertainty
